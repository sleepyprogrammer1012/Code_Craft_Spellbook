# 🧙‍♂️ CodeCraft Chronicles

**CodeCraft Chronicles** is a level-based educational game that teaches the fundamentals of game development through interactive coding challenges. Players unlock spells—JavaScript-like commands—that manipulate the game world, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Each level introduces a new spell and a unique challenge that requires using that spell (and sometimes combining it with previously learned ones). Players type code directly into the in-game spellbook to cast spells and progress.
