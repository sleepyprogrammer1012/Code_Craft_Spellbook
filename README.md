# Code Craft Spellbook
A game I'm planning on making called "Code Craft Spellbook". The aim of this game is to learn some basics of coding in an engaging way, I plan to add features as my coding journy unfolds and hopefully document it for others to follow. This is NOT a course! This IS STRICTLY FOR FUN!
